# DataStructures-Lab1-PhoneDirectory

This lab assignment involves creating a phone directory in C programming using linked lists and dynamic memory management. The program allows users to add, delete, and search for records based on phone numbers and names. It features a main menu with options to display the directory, add a record, delete a phone number, and search for a phone number or name. The program uses structs to define the directory and implements functions for each operation, highlighting memory allocation, string comparison, and pointer manipulation.
